# Bend playground

Twelve experiments: ray tracing, Conway's Game of Life, π from colliding blocks,
Rubik's cube, Monte Carlo π, Buffon's needle, circle times tables, Fourier series,
epicycles, Shakespeare's monkeys, sorting, and polar curves.
The numerical simulations run Bend 2 on native CPU or NVIDIA CUDA. Rubik's cube
and the interactive math/algorithm demos run Bend compiled to JavaScript in the browser.

## Visual playground

```sh
npm run raytracer -- --gpu
npm run life -- --gpu
npm run cubes -- --gpu --digits 3
npm run playground
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** to view the rendered scene, Life replay, and π
cubes. The viewer is a React app in `ui/` built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and
shadcn/ui (zinc theme). `npm run playground` builds it into `build/ui` and
starts the server; `npm run dev:ui` starts Vite with hot reload, proxying
`/api` and `/output` to a running `npm run serve`. You can change settings, choose CPU or GPU, and run each experiment from the viewer.
Life has play, pause, single-step, generation scrubbing, and speed controls.
The ray tracer saves plain-text RGB colors as `output/raytracer.ppm`, using the
P3 format from [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#outputanimage/theppmimageformat).
The browser reads those numbers into a canvas; Save PPM downloads the same file.
Choose **Original**, **Material study**, or **Weekend · field of spheres**.
The new scenes use Bend path tracing with diffuse, metal, and glass materials,
depth of field, configurable samples per pixel, and a repeatable random seed.

The **Rubik graph** tab (`#rubik`) has live face turns, scramble, undo, and
drag-to-orbit controls. Bend computes the sticker permutations; SVG draws the
cube and linked graph. Turns run locally without server requests or recompiling.
“Undo all” reverses the recorded moves; it is not a solver for arbitrary cubes.
The server builds the browser module once and reuses it until its source changes.

**Monte Carlo π** (`#montecarlo`) samples points in a square and uses
`π ≈ 4 × inside / total`. **Buffon's needle** (`#buffon`) drops unit toothpicks
across unit-width planks and uses `π ≈ 2 × drops / crossings`. Both have seeded
CPU/GPU sampling, exact integer counts, convergence charts, and animated replays.
Every sample is counted; at most 2,048 actual samples are drawn to keep large
runs quick to load. Neither estimator uses a π constant in its sampling code.

**Times table** (`#times-table`) animates `i → (multiplier × i) mod points`
from 0 to 200, including the cardioid at ×2. Play, pause, scrub, change speed,
or jump to a multiplier. Bend computes chord endpoints in a browser worker;
animation makes no server requests and does not recompile. This is a modular
multiplication visualization, not another estimator of π.

```sh
npm run probability -- --gpu --method montecarlo --samples 10000000 --seed 42
npm run probability -- --gpu --method buffon --samples 10000000 --seed 42
```

The **π cubes** tab animates Bend-computed collision positions and velocities,
with play/pause, step, reset, a timeline, and a velocity-space plot. Small runs
include every impact; large runs sample block/wall pairs at the requested mass
ratio. Playback follows physical time, with interpolation between samples. The digit
input has no application-level upper cutoff; the existing numerical and Nat
overflow limitations still apply.

Adapted from [the p5 projects](https://github.com/krymancer/p5-projects):

- **Fourier** (`#fourier`): rotating odd harmonics reconstruct a square wave.
- **Epicycles** (`#epicycles`): trace the original drawing or draw your own outline;
  change the number of Fourier terms live.
- **Shakespeare** (`#shakespeare`): evolve text with selection, crossover, and
  mutation, or compare with independent random typing. Supports custom targets.
- **Sorting** (`#sorting`): quicksort, merge sort, and bubble sort, with actual
  operation counts, play/pause, single-step, and scrubbing.
- **Polar curves** (`#polar`): heart, quadratic and Archimedean spirals, rose,
  and cardioid, with animated tracing and adjustable parameters.

These new tabs use cached Bend modules in browser workers. No server round trips
or recompilation occur during animation or settings changes.

On this machine, Tailscale Serve exposes the viewer privately at
**https://panam.tailcd7688.ts.net/**; append `#cubes` to open the cubes tab.
The local server must be running (`npm run playground`).

The run commands build the relevant native executable automatically. Omit
`--gpu` for CPU execution; use `--threads 8` to try multiple CPU cores. CUDA
setup is described below if this is a fresh checkout.

```sh
npm run raytracer -- --gpu --width 1024 --height 640 --bounces 4
npm run life -- --gpu --size 256 --steps 240 --pattern random --seed 123
npm run life -- --pattern glider --size 64 --steps 120
npm run bench:demos
```

Outputs go to `output/`. The browser only displays Bend's output; it does not
reimplement ray tracing or Life. See [demos/README.md](demos/README.md) for
controls, implementation details, validation, and measured performance.

## Pi from colliding blocks

A terminal implementation of the two blocks and wall from
[3Blue1Brown's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dTyOl1fmDo), with a
CPU version and a working NVIDIA GPU version. All numerical computation is
written in Bend 2. The scripts only build and launch the program.

## Run

```sh
npm run setup
PI_DIGITS=10 npm start
```

```text
Pi from composed collision transformations (two-float precision)
10 digits: 3141592653 collisions -> pi = 3.141592653
```

`PI_DIGITS` accepts positive integers with **no application-level upper cutoff**,
including the leading `3`; it defaults to 10. Results above 12 digits are
experimental and print a warning. Twelve digits correspond to **314,159,265,358 collisions** and a heavy
mass of `10^22` times the small mass. Counts use Bend's 48-bit `Nat`, avoiding
a 32-bit integer overflow.

Requirements: Git, Node.js 24+, and Bun. There are no npm dependencies. Setup
pins **Bend 2.0.5** in `.tools/bend` without changing your global tools. Bend 1
and HVM do not support this source. With Bend 2 installed, you can also run
`PI_DIGITS=10 bend main.bend`.

`npm start` runs the CPU/JavaScript version. To build a standalone CPU executable
(with Clang 14+; Bun is unnecessary for this path):

```sh
npm run build
PI_DIGITS=12 ./build/pi --threads 1
```

## Run on the GPU

The GPU path requires **Linux, an NVIDIA GPU and driver, Clang 19+, and CUDA
NVRTC**. It has been executed successfully on this machine's RTX 3050.

```sh
# If CUDA NVRTC is not already installed, install pinned NVIDIA libraries
# inside .tools/cuda (~93 MB download). Requires Python 3; no sudo or pip.
npm run setup:gpu
npm run build:gpu
PI_DIGITS=10 npm run gpu
```

If CUDA is already installed elsewhere, set `CUDA_HOME` before building and
running. The launcher uses `.tools/cuda` when available, otherwise
`/usr/local/cuda`. Local downloads are checked against pinned SHA-256 hashes.

The GPU command explicitly requests CUDA and fails if no compatible GPU is
available; it does not silently run the calculation on the CPU. It reserves
1 GiB for Bend's runtime, including its per-worker stacks. Keep
`build/pi-gpu.gpu` alongside `build/pi-gpu`.

The GPU evaluates **256 independent collision-index candidates per search
round** using Bend's parallel call syntax. The program is genuinely parallel,
but this does not imply it beats the CPU: composing transformations makes one
count so cheap that CUDA initialization and launch overhead can dominate.
For this workload, prefer measuring over assuming GPU acceleration.

## How large counts work

The small mass is 1. For `d` digits the heavy mass is `100^(d-1)`. Rather than
round that huge mass into one float, the accelerated solver represents its
inverse square root, `t = 10^(-(d-1))`, using two F32 components.

An elastic block collision followed by a wall reflection is a rotation of
scaled velocity space. Its coefficients come directly from the collision laws:

```text
a = (1 - t*t) / (1 + t*t)
b = 2*t / (1 + t*t)
```

Multiplying the complex pair `(a, b)` composes those two-impact transformations.
Exponentiation by squaring evaluates the velocity after `k` pairs in
`O(log k)` compositions. A parallel search locates the first pair whose wall
reflection would be unphysical, then checks whether the preceding pair had
already finished to distinguish an even from an odd collision count.

The search spans `0 < k <= 2/t`, where the relevant velocity sign crosses zero
once. Each round reduces that bracket by up to 256 times. It never visits all
billions of intermediate collisions. It uses **no stored pi value, trig
functions, or pi/angle count formula**. This is the collision-composition
approach selected for the larger-number version.

`precise.bend` implements TwoSum and Dekker TwoProduct with two F32 components,
retaining roughly 48 significant binary bits. It is finite precision, not
arbitrary precision. The 1–12 digit range is regression-tested. Higher requests
are allowed, but may return inaccurate results or fail on Bend's 48-bit integer
overflow; removing the input cutoff does not extend numeric precision. Do not build with
fast-math or floating-point reassociation. Bend's CUDA compiler explicitly
turns off fused contraction (`--fmad=false`).

Background:
[3Blue1Brown's velocity-space explanation](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/colliding-blocks-v2/)
and [Hida, Li and Bailey's floating-point expansion algorithms](https://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbpapers/arith15.pdf).

## Original event-by-event simulation

The original solver is preserved for learning and cross-checking:

```sh
npm run simulate                  # Show all four supported cases
PI_DIGITS=4 npm run simulate       # 3141 collisions -> 3.141
```

It advances directly to each block or wall impact. At a block collision:

```text
v' = ((1 - M)*v + 2*M*w) / (1 + M)
w' = (2*v + (M - 1)*w) / (1 + M)
```

At a wall impact, `v` changes sign. It stops when `0 <= v <= w`.
This reference solver retains its **1–4 digit** limit and 10,000-impact budget;
plain F32 velocity updates accumulate enough error to give wrong higher counts.

## Validation

```sh
npm test
npm run check
```

The 21 tests cover all 12 accelerated counts, both sides of the final search
boundary, two-float precision and cancellation, and equivalence of composed
and repeated transformations. They also compare the two solvers for 1–4 digits
and check the reference simulation's event ordering, contacts, energy,
momentum, reflection, termination and budget exhaustion.

`LAWS.bend` / `PROOF.bend` prove three structural properties of the original
reference solver: zero initial count, one increment per impact, and no change
after stopping. These proofs do **not** establish the accelerated algorithm's
floating-point accuracy or prove the pi theorem.
